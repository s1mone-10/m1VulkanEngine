# m1VulkanEngine

This is a personal project to learn Vulkan and C++. It is mainly based on the awesome tutorial at [vulkan-tutorial.com](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/).

The main goal is to create a structured engine with a class-based architecture.

_Disclaimer: I used AI tools intensively to help me in this project. So there might be some errors or suboptimal solutions._

## Current Features

*   Load and render textured `.obj` models.
*   Basic lighting (no shadows).
*   Compute pipeline implementation.
*   The project structure follows the progress of the vulkan-tutorial.com tutorial.

## Future Plans

This project is still under development. My next steps are:

*   Implement multithreading for rendering.
*   Explore and implement instancing.
*   Continue studying and implementing more advanced Vulkan features.
